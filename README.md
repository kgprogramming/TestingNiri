# Testing site https://niri-ic.com/home

### I am using linux and have chrome version 94, so if you use different OS or chrome version you will be need to add your chrome driver.
I got this task on my internship.

My task was to make tests for site NIRI. 

First test: to store text in list from blog page and to compare text from one page to other.

Second test: to verify that button lets talk is visible and clickable, verify that fields for email name and button are visible and to count all elements on page.

Third test: verifying that email is correct by using regex. To verify that mobile number doesn't have any letter. Verify does it mobile phone number have special characters.

All tests can be run from testNG run, also it can be run from Xml file. For running project you need installed SDK 11 on your machine.

I used POM pattern, but I need to tell that I wasn't make this framework.
